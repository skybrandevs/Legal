  <h3 class="client-header att">Our Principal & his team</h3>

  <p class="client-body-new ttt-2">The present principal in chambers, Mr.
    Olaotan Ajose-Adeogun was called to the
    Nigerian bar in 1984. Following his call to the
    bar, he served as junior counsel in the
    chambers of Professor A. B. Kasunmu, a Senior
    Advocate of Nigeria (SAN). It was here that he
    was exposed to litigation practice and
    corporate law at the highest levels.</p>

    <p class="client-body-new">Mr. Olaotan Ajose-Adeogun worked for
      Professor Kasunmu (SAN) for a period of five
      and a half years. In his time at Professor
      Kasunmu’s chambers, a new foundation was
      laid for the re-engineering of the old firm
      O.Ajose Adeogun & Co. This exercise
      commenced in 1988 with the formal
      registration and change of the firm name to
      OLAOTAN AJOSE - ADEOGUN & CO (The Rose
      Chambers).</p>


      <p class="client-body-new">The original firm O.Ajose Adeogun & Co was
        established in 1961 by Mr. Olatunji AjoseAdeogun who was called to the English bar
        (middle temple) in 1952. On his arrival from
        England he practiced with the law firm
        Thomas, Williams and Kayode, after which he
        took up employment with the L.E.D.B, which is 
        now the present-day Lagos State Development
        and Property Corporation. He remained in
        private legal practice until his elevation as a
        Judge of the High Court of Lagos State in 1975.
        In 1985 he was further elevated to the Court
        of Appeal from where he voluntarily retired in
        1987.</p>
